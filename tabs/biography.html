          <p>I completed my high school studies and Bachelors degree in Saskatoon. 
            After I graduated from University of Saskatchewan with a major on Biology
            and Biotechnology, I worked at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada as a Research 
            Assistant for a year and a half. While I was working there I realized I do not
            want to do this for rest of my life. That is when I started looking for other career
            prospects. I joined RBC as a client advisor and achieved certification in Investment
            Funds in Canada. While I was working at the bank, I was looking into career in the tech
            industry. I was fortunate to get the position of QA, Testing and Training Specialist
            at Vibe HCM. While Working at Vibe I realized I loved the job, loved the work evnironment
            and work type. I decided to move forward with this career. At the beginning of this year 
            I got married and moved to Toronto with my husband. We were looking into courses that would
            help me grow as a developer and I joined BrainStation to do diploma in Web Development. After that I believe I entered the world
            of challenges, possibilites and dreams.
